                    tory (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning "inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation")[2]
                    is the study of the past as it is described in written documents.[3][4] Events occurring before 
                    written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as
                    well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of 
                    information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians.

                    History can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse 
                    a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine 
                    them.[5][6] Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the 
                    study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing "perspective" on the problems 
                    of the present.[5][7][8][9]
                    
                    Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales 
                    surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends, because they do 
                    not show the "disinterested investigation" required of the discipline of history.[10][11] Herodotus, 
                    a 5th-century BC Greek historian is considered within the Western tradition to be the "father of history", 
                    and, along with his contemporary Thucydides, helped form the foundations for the modern study of human 
                    history. Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and 
                    the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. 
                    In East Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals was known to be compiled from as early as 
                    722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived.
