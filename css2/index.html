                    A textbook is a comprehensive compilation of content
                    in a branch of study. Textbooks are produced to meet
                    the needs of educators, usually at educational 
                    institutions. Schoolbooks are textbooks and other 
                    books used in schools. Today, many textbooks 
                    are published in both print format and digital formats.

                    History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning "inquiry, 
                    knowledge acquired by investigation") is the study of 
                    the past as it is described in written documents.Events 
                    occurring before written record are considered prehistory. 
                    It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as 
                    well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, 
                    presentation, and interpretation of information about 
                    these events. Scholars who write about history are called 
                    historians.

                    A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for 
                    transportation. Most definitions of car say they run 
                    primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four 
                    tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars 
                    came into global use during the 20th century, and developed 
                    economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the 
                    birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz 
                    patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely 
                    available in the early 20th century.

                    The Ford Model T (colloquially known as the Tin Lizzie, 
                    Leaping Lena, or flivver) is an automobile produced by Ford 
                    Motor Company from October 1, 1908, to May 26, 1927. It is 
                    generally regarded as the first affordable automobile, the 
                    car that opened travel to the common middle-class American; 
                    some of this was because of Ford's efficient fabrication, 
                    including assembly line production instead of individual 
                    hand crafting.

                    A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences
                    of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer 
                    programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized
